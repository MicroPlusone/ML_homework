first homework.
XOR function and perceptron

we know XOR is not a linear separable data set, hence perceptron can not reach 100 percent right. In this homework, we will add one more dimension for each sample, and the output is unchanged. I.e.,
(0,0,a) ＞＞＞0
(0,1,b) ＞＞＞1
(1,0,c) ＞＞＞1
(1,1,d) ＞＞＞0
where a,b,c,d takes value 0 or 1 independently. Out of 16 combinations, you need print out the total number and exact combinations {a,b,c,d} that produce zero errors with perceptron algorithm.

0. use perceptron, NOT MLP to train this data set
1. seed first if random is used; use comments to explain yourself; number of iterations should no larger than 100
2. everyone will submit one and only one.py file, which is named as
"ML1-yourName-yourID.py"
3. you may work as a group (no more than 5 person),but one should write codes independently, and list all participants' name in the comments; in the end, someone in the group will collect all python files and send me ONE zip file; please do NOT send rar file
5. if you have any question, ask in QQ group
